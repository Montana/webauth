Package: libapache2-mod-webauth
Section: httpd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, apache2 (>= 2.4.4)
Description: Apache modules for WebAuth authentication
 WebAuth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
 Kerberos.  It relies on a central authentication server that handles all
 user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
 credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.
 .
 This package contains the Apache modules to do basic authentication for
 individual web servers and to look up LDAP information using LDAP v3 with
 GSS-API binds about the authenticated user.  Directory information can be
 used for authorization control and to populate environment variables.
 These modules should be installed on any web server using WebAuth.

Description: Apache modules for a WebAuth authentication KDC
 WebAuth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
 Kerberos.  It relies on a central authentication server that handles all
 user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
 credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.
 .
 This package contains the Apache module for the central authentication
 server for a particular site.  Only one such server is needed; all web
 servers that use WebAuth will talk to this server to obtain and verify
 authentication credentials.

 user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
 credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.
 .
 This package is a transitional package to ease upgrades to the correct
 Apache module package naming scheme.  It can be safely removed.

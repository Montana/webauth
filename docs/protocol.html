<h1><br />WebAuth V3 Technical Specification</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Defines the WebAuth protocol for authenticating users to web
      applications using only the basic capabilities of a web browser.
      Authentication is handled by a central login server using a protocol
      local to the given site.  Authentication information is then passed
      to application servers via encrypted tokens in a URL and maintained
      by the browser as cookies.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
WebAuth Components</h3>

<p>The WebAuth protocol involves interactions between three basic
        components:
          </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>User-Agent (UA), the user's browser
</li>
<li>WebAuth-enabled Application Server (WAS), a web server that
               wants to serve content authenticated via WebAuth
</li>
<li>WebKDC, the login server and provider of authenticators to
               the other two components
</li>
</ol><p>
        
</p>
<p>The WebAuth protocol allows a WAS to securely identify a user
        accessing resources.  It also supports single sign-on, allowing a
        user to access multiple WebAuth-protected applications without
        having to authenticate to each one separately (unless an
        application requires this for security reasons).
</p>
<p>The WAS can also choose to either trust the WebKDC to vouch for
        the identity of a user, or it can request the WebKDC use an
        authenticator such as a Kerberos V5 service request (KRB_AP_REQ)
        that it can verify using its own Kerberos V5 keys.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.1.&nbsp;
User-Agent (UA)</h3>

<p>The User-Agent is a web browser that supports cookies.  No
          plugins, Java, or JavaScript are required. The UA will be
          redirected to the WebKDC as requested to by a WAS.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.2"></a><h3>1.1.2.&nbsp;
WebAuth-enabled Application
          Server (WAS)</h3>

<p>A WebAuth-enabled Application Server is a web server
          configured to use WebAuth to authenticate users.  If a user
          hasn't been authenticated yet (indicated by the UA possessing
          and presenting a WAS cookie), they will be redirected to the
          WebKDC.  Otherwise, the WebAuth-established authenticated
          identity will be used for access control.
</p>
<p>All interactions between the UA and WAS SHOULD be protected
          with TLS or SSL to prevent cookies being disclosed to an
          eavesdropper that could use those cookies to impersonate a user.
          The secure flag SHOULD be set on all WAS cookies to request that
          the browser enforce this.

<a name="rfc.section.1.1.3"></a><h3>1.1.3.&nbsp;
WebKDC</h3>

<p>The WebKDC will listen for two different type of requests,
          distinguished by different URLs.
</p>
<p>The first type of request are those requests coming from a UA
          after it has been redirected by a WAS.  This component of the
          WebKDC is referred to as the WebLogin service.  When the WebKDC
          receives one of these, it will first see if the request includes
          a cookie that contains cached credentials.  If the request
          contains a valid cookie, this cookie is used to obtain a new
          credentials and the user is redirected back to the WAS (unless
          the WAS has requested the user reauthenticate).  This is the way
          that WebAuth implements single sign-on.
</p>
<p>If the cookie is not present or has expired, then the user will
          be prompted for their username and password.  After submitting
          this information back to the WebKDC, the WebKDC will then verify
          the username and password, using whatever protocol is suitable
          for that site (Kerberos V5 is the default).  The WebKDC will the
          generate two "tokens".  One is placed in a cookie scoped for the
          WebKDC and used to provide single sign-on in future requests,
          and one that gets sent back to the WAS, which will verify it
          upon receipt.
</p>
<p>The second type of the WebKDC handles consist of XML messages
          that get POSTed to the WebKDC via HTTPS directly from a WAS.
          These message are used to establish keys for the WAS servers or
          to request additional credentials for a user.
</p>
<p>The WebKDC is also responsible for ensuring that the server
          making a request is authorized to make the request.  For
          example, one WAS server can't use a "token" that was created for
          use by another WAS server.
</p>
<p>All interactions between the UA or WAS and the WebKDC MUST be
          protected via TLS or SSL to prevent disclosure of passwords, as
          well as sensitive data such as the tokens which are used to
          provide single sign-on and access to application resources.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
WebAuth Tokens</h3>

<p>Tokens provide a standard mechanism to exchange and store
        information that is cryptographically secure from both tampering
        and disclosure.  Tokens also contain information such as creation
        times to help detect replays, and expiration times so data is
        never trusted/used forever.  Tokens also enable authentication of
        the servers using them.
</p>
<p>Tokens get transfered between servers using URL query
        parameters, POST data, cookies, and XML documents.  They are
        AES-encrypted using either a private key, or a shared session key.
        They also include a SHA1 HMAC used to detect data modification or
        tampering.
</p>
<p>There are currently nine different types of tokens:
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>webkdc-service (encrypted with WebKDC private key)</dt>
<dd>
            The webkdc-service-token is used by
            WebAuth App Servers to communicate with the WebKDC.  It
            contains a session key that is shared between the WebKDC and
            the WAS.  <br />
<br />
 webkdc-service tokens are
            created only by the WebKDC, and are used only by a WAS.  From
            the perspective of the WAS, they are opaque blobs that are
            sent back to the WebKDC
</dd>
<dt>webkdc-proxy (encrypted with WebKDC private key)</dt>
<dd>
            The webkdc-proxy-token contains a

            Kerberos V5 TGT).  It can only be decrypted by the WebKDC, and
            the WebKDC will only allow a webkdc-proxy token to be used by
            the server it was originally generated for.  The main use of a
            webkdc-proxy token is by the WebKDC itself to implement single
            sign-on; that webkdc-proxy token is usually put in a cookie
            scoped to the WebLogin service.  Its secondary use is to allow
            WAS servers to request credential-tokens.

<dt>request (encrypted with session key)</dt>
<dd>
            The request token contains the request
            from a WAS for a token (usually an id token) from the WebKDC.
            It is AES-encrypted in a session key from a webkdc-service
            token, and contains information like the return URL and type
            of token requested.  A webkdc-service token is always included

</dd>
<dt>error (encrypted with session key)</dt>

            An error token is returned by the
            WebKDC in the event of an unrecoverable error that occurred
            while asking for a token with a request token.
</dd>
<dt>id (encrypted with session key)</dt>
<dd>
            An id token contains the identity of
            the user trying to access a resource.  The WAS will verify the
            id token and then will normally construct an app token for
            future use.

<dt>proxy (encrypted with session key)</dt>
<dd>
            A proxy token is used to return a

            type.
</dd>
<dt>cred (encrypted with session key)</dt>
<dd>
            A credential token contains a

Security Model and Key Management</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, tokens are at the heart
        of the WebAuth security model.  They are used to authenticate
        requests and responses between servers, as well as protect data
        that is stored in URLs and cookies.  Shared symmetric keys
        (session keys) are used to encrypt tokens between servers, and
        private keys are used to encrypt tokens meant for a only a single
        server to decrypt.
</p>
<p>Also note that any tokens that appear in URLs are tokens that
        are only valid for a short period of time (5 minutes by
        default).  Any attempt to re-use them after that will fail.  If a
        user bookmarks a URL with a token in it (or hits their "back"
        button) then one of three things can happen:
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The user has a valid cookie. In this case, the token in the
            URL is ignored (but still stripped out from the URL before
            passing it to the app), so there is no problem.
</li>
<li>The user has no valid cookie, but the token in the URL is
            still valid.  In this case, the user will be authenticated and
            a cookie will be created.  Note that this can only happen
            until the token is no longer "fresh" (as mentioned, 5 minutes
            by default).
</li>
<li>The user has no valid cookie, and the token is too old. In
            this case, the user will be redirected to the login page is
            usual (the token will be stripped from the URL before the
            redirect).
</li>

Distributing and Managing
          Session Keys</h3>

<p>In order to exchange session keys, a key distribution
          protocol is needed.  For this purpose, we use Kerberos V5 and
          TLS/SSL to bootstrap and get the session keys.  The WAS that
          needs a session key will post an XML message to the WebKDC
          requesting a service token.  This message contains a KRB_AP_REQ
          for the WebKDC's server principal, which the WebKDC uses to
          authenticate the server making the request.  The WebKDC will
          then send back the service token and a copy the session key that
          is also encrypted (in the WebKDC's key) inside of the service
          token.  The WAS will need both to make future requests to the
          WebKDC.  The whole transaction itself is protected with TLS or
          SSL.
</p>
<p>There are no long term keys stored on the WebKDC itself other
          its own private key.  Once the WAS obtains the service token and
          session key, it will cache them both until the service token
          expires.  Before the service token expires, the WAS must request
          a new service token and will be given a corresponding new
          session key.
</p>
<p>The WebAuth protocol is designed so that other authentication
          mechanisms may be used to bootstrap, such as GSS-API or TLS
          client authentication between servers.  Kerberos V5 is just the
          first implemented bootstrap authentication mechanism.
</p>
<p>One potential issue here is that potentially weaker keys
          (Kerberos V5 keytabs, which could be 3DES or even just DES) are
          being used to bootstrap into stronger WebAuth AES keys.  This
          issue is partially mitigated by the use of TLS or SSL to further
          protect the transaction.  This seems to be an acceptable risk,
          but it's worth being aware of.  The Kerberos V5 infrastructure
          should obviously use as strong of keys as possible.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3.2"></a><h3>1.3.2.&nbsp;
Distributing and Managing
          Private Keys</h3>

<p>Both the WebKDC and the WAS servers need private keys to
          encrypt their tokens with.  These keys will be
          randomly-generated 128-bit AES keys (longer keys are supported
          if needed).  They are stored in key rings on the WebKDC or WAS
          server.  The key ring SHOULD support holding both currently
          valid keys and keys that will be valid in the future.
</p>
<p>Since key rings are never sent over the network by the
          WebAuth protocol, WebAuth implementations can use whatever
          mechanism they wish to store keys.  However, the following
          data should be stored for each key:
            </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>key type</dt>
<dd>Type of the
              key.  AES is the only supported key type right now.
</dd>
<dt>key data</dt>
<dd>The binary
              data that makes up the key.
</dd>
<dt>creation</dt>
<dd>Time the key
              was created.
</dd>
<dt>valid_after</dt>
<dd>When the
              key becomes valid.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>
          
</p>
<p>Of note is the valid_after value.  It is used to create
          post-dated keys in the key ring, to allow for new keys to get
          generated and distributed among a pool of servers (for load
          balancing/fail-over) in such a way that all the keys can be
          updated before the key becomes valid.
</p>
<p>There is no support in the WebAuth protocol itself for
          distributing key rings among pools of servers, but a mechanism
          such as SSH can be used.
</p>
<p>Stand-alone servers (not part of a pool) SHOULD automatically
          generate new keys when needed on a restart.

<a name="rfc.section.1.3.3"></a><h3>1.3.3.&nbsp;
Supporting Server Pools</h3>

<p>In order to support server pools, we need to ensure that any
          server that receives a token is able to decrypt and verify
          it.  Note that we are only talking about the WebAuth protocol
          here.  Applications must solve their own synchronization issues
          as well when using a pool of servers as a front end.
</p>
<p>For the WebKDC, all we need to do is distribute the same key
          ring across all the WebKDCs.  Post-dating new keys when adding
          them makes this task easier, since the key ring only has to be
          updated on all WebKDCs by the time the key becomes valid.
</p>
<p>For a WAS, there are two issues.  First, we also need to
          distribute the key ring so all WAS servers can decrypt their
          app-tokens.  The second question is how to deal with session
          keys.
</p>
<p>Responses from the WebKDC come back to the WAS encrypted
          in the session key, not the WAS server's private key.  If the
          response comes back to a different WAS server, it will not have
          the same session key that the requesting WAS server had.  One
          could work around this by sharing the same service token and
          session key across all the servers, but this would be painful
          and expensive to do.
</p>
<p>The most flexible and recommended solution is for WAS servers
          to include some state (described below) in each request token.
          The WebKDC treats this state as opaque data and returns it to
          the WAS server along with the requested token.  It is
          transmitted alongside the returned token, not inside it, so that
          the WAS doesn't have to know the session key to read it.  To use
          this method, the WAS server creates an app token (which is
          encrypted in its private key, shared among all the sytsems in
          the pool), includes in it the session key, and sends this as the
          state in the request token.  Since the WebKDC returns this state
          along with its response, any WAS in the pool can then decrypt
          the state with its private key, recover the session key, and
          then use that to decrypt the rest of the response.
</p>
<p>Another somewhat simpler way to handle this is make sure that
          the return URL in the request token contains the server's
          private hostname or IP address instead of the virtual or pool
          address.  This solves the problem as the request always comes
          back to WAS server that initiated the request.  However, this
          means that the real server name or IP address must be exposed to
          the UA and transparent failover among systems in the pool will
          not be supported.

No Tokens (Initial Sign-On)</h3>

<p>The first scenario is a user request to a
          WebAuth-protected resource without any prior WebAuth login and
          without any authentication cookies.  In other words, there is no
          app token or proxy token in the UA cookie jar.

</pre></div>
<p>The first and second steps normally happen when the
          WAS is first started or when its previous service token expire
          and are included for completeness.  They are omitted in all
          further scenarios, but should be assumed to happen when
          needed.
</p>
<p>
          </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The WAS connects directly to the WebKDC and requests a
            service token and session key to use for further requests.  It
            includes in this request a KRB_AP_REQ for the WebKDC's service
            principal, using the WAS's private Kerberos key.
</li>
<li>The WebKDC authenticates the WAS server via Kerberos V5 and
            returns the webkdc-service token and corresponding session
            key.
</li>
<li>The UA requests a WebAuth-protected resource from WAS.
</li>
<li>No app token is found either in a cookie or in the URL, so
            the WAS constructs a request token, asking for an id token.
            The request token also contains the return URL, requested type
            of token, and any additional desired options.  It may also
            contain an app token with the session key encrypted in the
            WAS's private key (for handling server pools).  The request
            token is encrypted with the AES session key shared between the
            WAS and the WebKDC.  The WAS then returns a temporary redirect
            to the UA, sending the UA to the WebLogin component of the
            WebKDC and including the request token in the redirect
            URL.
</li>
<li>The US follows the redirect and sends a request to the
            WebLogin component of the WebKDC, including the request token
            in the URL.  No cookies are sent to the WebKDC since the user
            has never previously authenticated.
</li>
<li>The WebKDC decrypts the request token, checks the creation
            time to make sure the request is fresh, and sends back a login
            form or other authentication prompt to the UA.  The request
            token or needed information derived from it will generally be
            included in a hidden form field.  (This assumes that a form
            prompt is needed to authenticate the user.  If the user can be
            authenticated directly by the WebLogin server via some method
            such as SPNEGO, it may skip sending back a login form and
            therefore also skip the next step, proceeding directly to
            checking the authorization of the WAS.)
</li>
<li>The user enters their username and password or other
            authentication credentials and instructs their UA to submit
            the form back to the WebKDC.
</li>
<li>The WebKDC validates the username and password or other
            authentication credentials and also makes sure that the WAS is
            allowed to request the token asked for in the request token.
            Assuming the username and password are valid, the WebKDC
            constructs a webkdc-proxy token and the id token and then
            sends a confirmation page back to the UA which includes a link
            back to the WAS that contains the id token (and any additional
            state information sent by the WAS) in the URL.  The response
            page also sets a cookie containing the webkdc-proxy token.
            (For some forms of authentication that can be repeated without
            prompting the user, such as SPNEGO, the WebKDC may decide not
            to set a webkdc-proxy cookie.)
</li>
<li>When the user follows the link on the confirmation page,
            the UA will re-request the original resource but now with the
            id token included in the URL.
</li>
<li>The WAS will see the id token in the URL and will check to
            ensure it is fresh.  It will then look at the subject
            authenticator-type in the token to see if it needs to verify
            the subject.  If the authenticator-type is krb5, it uses its
            Kerberos keytab to verify the identity of the subject.  In
            this case, the token will include a KRB_AP_REQ for the
            Kerberos identity of the WAS in the subject authenticator data
            field of the id token.
            <br />
<br />

            After verifying the subject if desired, the WAS creates an app
            token based on the id token and puts it into a cookie to
            authenticate future requests from that UA.  The app token will
            inherit the expiration time of the id token.  The WAS then
            passes the request to the underlying web application,
            stripping the id token from the URL before doing so and
            including the WebAuth-derived authentication information.
            When the web application returns the resource, the WAS adds a
            header to set the app token before sending that resource back
            to the UA.
</li>
</ol><p>
        
</p>
<p>The above assumes that the WAS will use a WebAuth app token in
        a cookie for further session authentication.  An equally valid
        choice from a protocol perspective would be for the WAS to create
        its own authentication cookies and not bother with an app token.
        Whether to do this or use app tokens is a decision entirely
        internal to the WAS, but note that the metadata in the id token
        (particularly the expiration time) MUST be honored by the WAS.
</p>
<p>All cookies set by the WebAuth protocol MUST be session cookies
        that are destroyed when the browser is closed.  This allows the
        user to easily log out by closing the browser before the tokens in
        the cookies expire.

No App Token, Credentials Required</h3>

<p>In the fourth scenario, the user requests a
          WebAuth-protected resource that needs proxied credentials to act
          on the user's behalf.  In this case, the WAS must request a

          credentials via the XML interface.  In the below discussion, we
          assume the US already has a webkdc-proxy cookie and the WebKDC
          can use single sign-on, but this is not required.  If there is
          no webkdc-proxy cookie, the user will be prompted for

<li>The UA requests a WebAuth-protected resource from the

</li>
<li>The WAS sees no app token containing the required
            credentials and constructs a request token asking for a proxy
            token of the desired type.  It then returns a redirect to the
            WebLogin component of the WebKDC, including the request token
            in the URL, as previously.  The only difference is in the
            contents of the request token.
</li>
<li>The UA follows the redirect to the WebKDC, including the
            request token in the URL and the webkdc-proxy token for the
            WebKDC itself since the user had previously authenticated.
</li>
<li>The WebKDC decrypts and validates the webkdc-proxy token
            and uses it to construct a proxy token as requested by the
            WAS.  It then returns a confirmation page containing a link to
            the return URL with the proxy token embedded in the URL (along
            with any additional state information requested), as
            before.
</li>
<li>The user follows the link and the UA re-requests the
            original resource, now including the proxy token in the
            URL.
</li>
<li>The WAS decrypts and verifies the proxy token and recovers
            from it the embedded webkdc-proxy token.  It then sends an XML
            request direct to the WebKDC, including its webkdc-service
            token and the webkdc-proxy token, requesting an id token and
            whatever credential tokens it needs.
</li>
<li>The WebKDC receives the webkdc-service token and
            webkdc-proxy token, verifies that the subject of the
            webkdc-service token is permitted to use the webkdc-proxy
            token and verifies that it is allowed to request that type of
            credential token.  If everything is okay, it returns the
            requested id and credential tokens.
</li>
<li>After verifying the returned id token, the WAS will create
            an app token for further authentication.  It will also often
            create new app tokens containing the provided credentials for
            its own futher use so that it doesn't have to keep asking for
            credential tokens or store them locally.  The request is then
            passed to the web application, along with the user's identity
            and the credentials, and the result passed back to the UA
            along with the new cookies.
</li>
</ol><p>
        
</p>
<p>Normally, the requested credential tokens will be Kerberos
        service tickets that the WAS can then use to talk to other
        services that use Kerberos authentication.  Since the webkdc-proxy
        token is generally a Kerberos V5 TGT, this works together well and
        allows WebAuth to treat the UA's cookie jar as essentially a
        Kerberos V5 ticket cache.  However, this is not required by the
        protocol and credential tokens may be any form of credential
        supported by the WAS and WebKDC.
</p>
<p>As with an id token, the WAS may choose not to put the
        credentials in an app token for subsequent use.  It may instead
        want to store them on the server tied to a session cookie or some
        other internal state-tracking mechanism.  However, the metadata in
        the credential tokens (particularly expiration time) MUST be
        honored.
</p>
<p>The credentials returned by the WebKDC in a credential token
        SHOULD encode an expiration time that cannot be manipulated by the
        WAS so that the WAS is need not be trusted to honor credential
        expiration.

Logging Out</h3>

<p>The only fully effective way to log out of WebAuth is to close
        the browsing session, which will cause all WebAuth cookies to be
        discarded since they all MUST be session cookies.  This is a
        weakness in the WebAuth protocol created by the use of scoped
        cookies to hold all authentication information.  Fixing it
        requires keeping additional queriable state outside of the user's
        cookies and the WAS and WebKDC keys.
</p>
<p>Logging out of an application requires removing all session
        cookies associated with a given application on a given server
        removed.  This can be achieved with a logout link available
        within the application itself that leads to a page that clears
        all the cookies.  A WebAuth WAS implementation SHOULD provide
        some simple way for an application developer to indicate that
        going to a given URL should remove all app cookies.
</p>
<p>After logging out of the application, the user can also be
        sent to a logout page on the WebKDC that removes the
        webkdc-proxy cookie used for single sign-on.  After going to
        such a page, the user will have to reauthenticate to access any
        new web application.  However, their UA will retain app cookies
        for other applications they have already used in this session
        and have not logged out of, so the user SHOULD be warned to
        close the browser to fully log out.
</p>
<p>There is a field in the app token in which the WAS may record
        a session timeout, causing the app token to become invalid if it
        is not used within a certain period of time.  The WAS may also
        request in a request token that the webkdc-proxy token be
        ignored and the user be forced to re-authenticate even if
        already authenticated.

Redirects to the WebKDC</h3>

<p>Each WAS will be configured with a URL to redirect a UA to when
        the user needs to be authenticated.  When making an authentication
        request, the WAS must include both the request token and the
        webkdc-service token (the latter so that the WebKDC can decrypt
        the request token).  These tokens will be passed via query
        parameters in the URL.
</p>
<p>The format is:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  https://{host}/{webkdc-uri}?RT={request-token};ST={service-token}
</pre></div>
<p>where RT is the base64-encoded request token and ST
          is the base64-encoded service token.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Redirects to the WAS</h3>

<p>When the WebKDC sends the UA back to the WAS with an id or
        proxy token, it will construct a return URL by taking the
        return-url specified in the request token and appending
        "?WEBAUTHR={token};" to it, where {token} is the requested token.
        If the "as" (application state) attribute was specified in the
        request token, it is base64-encoded and then appended to the URL
        (always after WEBAUTHR) as "WEBAUTHS={state};" where {state} is
        the application state provided in the request token.
</p>
<p>To be precise, the format is:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  {return-url}?WEBAUTHR={token}[;WEBAUTHS={state};]
</pre></div>
<p>where the part in [] is optional.
</p>
<p>The WAS will generally strip the added components off the URL
        before passing the request to the underlying web application.  It
        may verify the token, construct an app token, and return a
        redirect to the same URL with the WebAuth data stripped and the
        cookie set rather than immediately passing the request to the
        application, to "clean up" the URL in the UA, avoid embedding
        outdated tokens in bookmarks, and confusing applications that are
        aware of their own URLs.

XML Protocol Overview</h3>

<p>The protocol consists of an exchange of XML-formatted messages

        XML message response from the server.

<p>For ease of parsing, for any elements that require a
        base64-encoded value, there must be no whitespace after the open
        element and before the close element.
</p>
<p>For example, this is valid:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  &lt;requestToken&gt;{base64-webkdc-service-token}&lt;/requestToken&gt;

<p>while this is not:

  &lt;requestToken&gt;
      {base64-webkdc-service-token}
  &lt;/requestToken&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>The spec uses whitespace in the following examples for
        readability, but bearing in mind the above, it should be omitted
        in practice.

    &lt;!-- rest depends on command --&gt;
  &lt;/xxxxRequest&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>where xxxx is the type of request.

<p>The command response format on success is:

        webkdcProxyToken command converts an existing credential (such as
        a Kerberos V5 TGT) into a webkdc-proxy token and can be used to
        bootstrap WebAuth authentication from an existing Kerberos ticket
        cache for improved single sign-on.  The webkdcProxyTokenInfo
        command returns information about an existing webkdc-proxy
        token.

<p>When the WAS is requesting a webkdc-service token and a
          corresponding session key, it provides requesterCredentials of
          type "krb5", does not include subjectCredential or requestToken,
          and asks only for a single service token.  Otherwise, it
          provides requesterCredentials of type "service", includes the
          proxy token in subjectCredential and a request token, and asks
          for one or more "id" or "cred" tokens.
</p>
<p>requesterCredentials of type "krb5" can only be used to obtain
          a webkdc-service token.  They can't be used for obtaining any
          other tokens, nor can a credential of type "service" be used to
          request another webkdc-service token.  In all other cases, the
          requesterCredentials are a webkdc-service token.
</p>
<p>subjectCredentials are required when requesting id, proxy, or
          cred tokens.

Token Encoding</h3>

<p>All encrypted tokens have the following general
          encoding:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  {key-hint}{nonce}{hmac}{token-attributes}{padding}
</pre></div>
<p>Everything except {key-hint} is AES-encrypted.
</p>
<p>{key-hint} is a four-byte Unix UTC time stored in network byte
        order.  It is not encrypted and is used only as a hint for the
        server to determine which key to use to decrypt the token.  It
        MUST NOT be used for any other purpose as its value is not
        protected from modification.
</p>
<p>{nonce} is 16 random bytes and is encrypted with the rest of
        the data in the token.  It is used to ensure that two tokens with
        the same data and same encryption key don't encrypt to the same
        value.
</p>
<p>{hmac} is the SHA1 HMAC of the actual data including the
        padding (in other words, the pre-encryption concatenation of
        {token-attributes} and {padding}).  The key used with HMAC is the
        AES private key.  (A better solution would be to use a different
        key, but that requires having two keys or using a key-derivation
        function to derive the HMAC key from the AES key.  One possible
        future approach would be to use a key-derivation function like TLS
        uses.
</p>
<p>{token-attributes} is a sequence of name=value pairs, separated
        by a ';' character.  Names are not allowed to contain either '='
        or ';'.  Values MAY contain binary data, but MUST escape any ';'
        in the data by adding an additional ';'.
</p>
<p>For example, if we had the following names and
          values:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  a=1
  msg=hello;there
  bin={binarydata}
  b=2
</pre></div>
<p>They would be encoded as:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  a=1;msg=hello;;there;bin={binarydata};b=2;
</pre></div>
<p>{padding} is any padding of the data required to make the
        length a multiple of 16 bytes for AES encryption.  There is always
        padding present.  If the length is already a multiple of 16 bytes,
        16 bytes of padding will be added.  The value of each padding byte
        MUST be equal to the length of the padding.  For example, if the
        padding length is 7, each byte in the padding must be equal to
        0x07.
</p>
<p>The whole token is base64-encoded before being used in XML
        data, a cookie, or a query parameter.

<dd>
            The identity of the service credential

            Creation time of the token.  For tokens
            used to exchange messages between servers (request, error, id,
            proxy, credential), this value is used to ensure that the
            request is fresh.  For example, tokens of this type with a ct
            older then 5 minutes will get flagged by the server (WAS or
            WebKDC) as being stale.
</dd>
<dt>ec (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Error code from the WebKDC.  This will

</dd>
<dt>em (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Error message from the WebKDC.  This

<dt>lt (binary time)</dt>
<dd>
            Last-used time.  If this attribute is
            set in an app token present in a cookie, the WAS SHOULD
            periodically update it (by setting a new cookie with an
            updated last-used time) as it is used for access.  This
            attribute is used to implement timing out of unused but still
            unexpired app tokens.
</dd>
<dt>p (string)</dt>
<dd>
            User's password, in a login token.

            Proxy subject, the subject from the
            webkdc-service token that was used when the webkdc-proxy token
            was created.  This is used to verify that a webkdc-proxy token
            is being used by the same entity as originally requested
            it.
</dd>
<dt>pt (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Proxy type (such as krb5).
</dd>
<dt>ro (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Comma-separated list of request
            options.  Currently, the following options are supported: lc,
            to return an error code to the application if login is
            cancelled; and fa, to force interactive authentication even if
            the user has a webkdc-proxy token.
</dd>
<dt>rtt (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Requested token type in a request
            token.  This is either id for an id token or proxy for a proxy
            token.
</dd>
<dt>ru (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Return URL.  The user to return the
            user to after authentication.
</dd>
<dt>s (string)</dt>
<dd>
            The authenticated subject.  In
            webkdc-service tokens, this is the server identity that
            authenticated to get the webkdc-service token.  In all other
            tokens, it is the user who authenticated.  Server subjects
            have the form "type:identifier".  Currently, the only defined
            type is "krb5" indicating that the server authenticated with
            Kerberos V5, and in that case the identifier is the text form
            of a fully qualified Kerberos V5 principal.
</dd>
<dt>sa (string)</dt>
<dd>
            Subject authenticator type in an id
            token.  This is currently either krb5, indicating that a
            Kerberos V5 authenticator is included, or webkdc, indicating
            no additional authenticator is provided.
</dd>
<dt>sad (binary)</dt>
<dd>
            Subject authenticator data.  If the sa
            is krb5, this is a KRB_AP_REQ for the same Kerberos V5
            principal as the webkdc-service token's subject.
</dd>
<dt>t (string)</dt>
<dd>
            The token type.  Currently recognized
            token types are webkdc-service, webkdc-proxy, req, error, id,
            proxy, cred, and app.  Used by a server to ensure that a token
            is being used for the correct purpose.
</dd>
<dt>wt (binary)</dt>
<dd>
            A webkdc-proxy or webkdc-service token
            that is being included inside another token.
</dd>
<dt>u (string)</dt>
<dd>

<p>All attributes are AES-encrypted in the WebKDC's private

</pre></div>
<p>All attributes are AES-encrypted in the WebKDC's private

<p>As a special case, webkdc-proxy tokens that the WebKDC
          obtains on behalf of itself (returned as part of a

          WEBKDC:krb5:{server-principal} where {server-principal} is the
          Kerberos principal of the WebKDC.
</p>
<p>When a webkdc-proxy-token is used, the WebKDC checks that the
          subject in the webkdc-service token accompanying the request is
          authorized to used the webkdc-proxy token granted to the ps
          subject or that the ps subject starts with "WEBKDC:".

request Token Encoding</h3>

<p>A request token is sent to the WebKDC server by a WAS along
          with the WAS's webkdc-service token.  It is used to request
          tokens via the HTML interface, and is also used with the XML
          interface (in a restricted form) to allow the WebKDC to verify
          that a request being made with a webkdc-service token is both
          recent and for the specified command.
</p>
<p>The first form is used with the requestTokenRequest
            command:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  t=req

  rtt=id|proxy
  # for rt=id
  sa=krb5|webkdc
  # for rt=proxy
  pt=krb5
</pre></div>
<p>The second form is used with the getTokensRequest
            command in the XML interface:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
  t=req
  ct={creation-time}
  cmd={xml-command-we-are-going-to-execute}
</pre></div>
<p>All attributes are AES-encrypted in the webkdc-service token
          session key.
</p>
<p>The value of ct is used to prevent replay attacks.  Values
          older than a certain time (probably 5 minutes by default) should
          be rejected as a replay.
</p>
<p>cmd indicates which XML command we are invoking (for example,
          getTokensRequest).  The WebKDC will compare this command against
          the name of the command in the XML, thereby verifying the
          unencrypted XML request.

          krb5 webkdc-procy token.
</p>
<p>If at is webkdc, we are trusting the webkdc and "s" contains
          the authenticated user's identity (generally as a Kerberos V5

<p>The value of ct is used to prevent replay attacks.  Values

<p>The value of et is used to let the application know how long

<p>Kerberos v5 credentials may be included in several types of

Cookie Formats</h3>

<p>Cookies are used to hold tokens in a UA for future use.  All
      cookies MUST be scoped to a single server; there are no domain-wide
      cookies.  All cookies will be encoded in base64 before passing them
      to the UA.
</p>
<p>The tokens that are put in cookies are webkdc-proxy, proxy, app,
      and cred tokens.  The following naming convention will be used to
      name cookies.
</p>
<p>Note that proxy tokens and credential tokens are originally
      encrypted in the webkdc-service token session key, but are
      re-encrypted using the WAS private key before being stored in a
      cookie.
</p>
<p>app token cookies will be named webauth_at.
</p>
<p>webkdc-proxy token cookies will be named webauth_wpt_{type} where
      {type} is the type of the webkdc-proxy token (usually krb5).
</p>
<p>proxy token cookies will be named webauth_pt_{type} where {type}
      is the type of the proxy token (usually krb5).
</p>
<p>credential tokens will be named webauth_ct_{type}_{service} where
      {type} is the type of the credential token (usually krb5) and
      {service} is the krb5 service name, potentially with special
      characters escaped.

<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>0.1 (2002-10-02, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          First draft.
</dd>
<dt>0.2 (2002-10-04, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Fixed typos and added more text in
          section 1.2.  Use SHA1 everywhere instead of MD5.  Change
          attribute separator in tokes from "\n" to ';'.  Change time
          attributes inside of tokens from four-byte binary network byte
          order to ASCII strings.  Changed description of time prepended
          to tokens from {creation-time} to {key-hint}.
</dd>
<dt>0.3 (2002-10-07, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Major changes.  Combine LS and WKDC into
          WebKDC.
</dd>
<dt>0.4 (2002-10-26, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Change time attributes inside tokens
          back to four byte binary network byte order.  Get rid of default
          values for attributes.  Requested token is now contained within
          the response token.  Got rid of unneeded or not fleshed out
          token attributes (rth, san, ver).  Add new token attributes (rt,
          rt-t, rt-et, sad).  Change the id token to use sad instead of s
          for krb5.
</dd>
<dt>0.5 (2002-10-30, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Use errorResponse message for indicating
          errors.  Remove app names for now; will re-specify when
          requirements are more clear.  Change et in it token to se to
          indicate when the subject expires.
</dd>
<dt>0.6 (2002-11-01, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Rename service token and proxy token to
          webkdc-service token and webkdc-proxy token to signify that they
          are only used by the WebKDC.  Remove response token and add
          error token and new proxy token.  The response from a request
          token is an error token, id token, or proxy token.  change se
          back to et.  Expiration times in tokens indicate when the token
          expires and when any data within the token (subject info, proxy
          data, etc.)  expires.  Simplify XML messages by placing
          base64-encoded data directly in &lt;requestCredential> and
          &lt;subjectCredential> instead of having them in another tag.
          Wrap tokens in &lt;tokens> element to make it easier to interate
          through all the tokens in a &lt;getTokensRequest>.
</dd>
<dt>0.61 (2002-11-03, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Add a new form of request token that is
          sent in XML requests along with a webkdc-service token to
          indicate which XML command is being requested.  Update
          &lt;requesterCredential> for type "service" to include
          &lt;serviceToken> and &lt;requestToken>.
</dd>
<dt>0.7 (2002-11-05, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Rename prt/prd/pro attributes to
          pt/pd/ps.  Formatting and clarification.
</dd>
<dt>0.8 (2002-11-07, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Add a section on the security model and
          support for sending application state in a request token to
          enable server pools.
</dd>
<dt>0.85 (2002-11-08, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Forgot to add a final WebAuth redirect
          in the usage scenarios that sets the cookies and re-requests the
          original URL.
</dd>
<dt>0.90 (2002-11-13, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Undo 0.85, since after initial Apache
          prototyping I think we can get away without doing the extra
          redirect.  Add some text to the security model section
          describing what happens if a user bookmarks or replays a URL
          with a token in it.
</dd>
<dt>0.91 (2002-11-14, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Don't rewrite proxy/cred tokens into app
          tokens before storing them in cookies.  Just re-encrypt them
          using the WAS private key.  This is so that they can't be used
          as app tokens.  Change the name of proxy/webkdc-proxy
          cookies.
</dd>
<dt>0.99 (2002-12-04, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Document error codes for &lt;errorCode>.
          Add new requestToken command for the WebKDC web front-end to use
          to talk to the WebKDC.  Recommended URL for WebKDC POST is now
          /webkdc-service/.  Remove line that says an &lt;errorCode> can
          occur within a &lt;token> returned in a &lt;getTokensResponse>;
          the whole request succeeds or fails.  Update format for
          &lt;subjectCredential> to be consistent across XML commands.
          Update format for &lt;requesterCredential> by moving
          &lt;requestToken> out into enclosing element, which also removes
          the need for the &lt;serviceToken> element.  Also consistent
          across commands.  Only subject names in webkdc-service tokens
          have the form "krb5:{principal}"; subject names referring to
          users will have only the username (unless krb5 is used and the
          call to krb5_aname_to_localname fails, in which case the
          fully-qualified principal name is used).  Remove inactivity
          timeout value from token.  Change rr (request reason) token
          attribute to ro (request options).  Add lc (login cancelled) and
          fa (forced authentication) to request options.  Add
          &lt;loginCancelledToken> to requestToken command response.  Add
          two new error codes for forced authentication and login
          cancelled.
</dd>
<dt>1.00 (2002-12-06, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Add &lt;loginErrorCode> and
          &lt;loginErrorMessage> to &lt;requestTokenResponse>.
</dd>
<dt>1.01 (2002-12-12, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Keys in the keyring no longer expire.
          The key with the most current (but not post-dated) valid_after
          will always be used to encrypt new keys.
</dd>
<dt>1.02 (2003-01-14, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Return &lt;subject> in &lt;requestToken>
          response so the web front-end can display the authenticated
          username.
</dd>
<dt>1.03 (2003-01-20, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Fix type in credential token coding
          example: change ct to crt.  Add crs attribute to credential
          token.
</dd>
<dt>1.04 (2003-01-29, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          When appending WEBAUTHR to return URL,
          use "?WEBAUTHR=...;" instead of ";WEBAUTHR=...;" so browers
          handle relative URLs correctly.
</dd>
<dt>1.05 (2003-07-24, schemers)</dt>
<dd>
          Add webkdcProxyToken and
          webkdcProxyTokenInfo commands.  Added requestInfo to
          requestToken command for S/Ident support.
</dd>
<dt>2.00 (2006-01-02, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Rewritten in XML and substantially
          edited, clarified, and reworked.  Added &lt;remoteUser> to
          &lt;requestInfo> and clarified that &lt;requestInfo> must be
          used only for logging and auditing now that we're not trying to
          do S/Ident any more.  Don't assume Kerberos in the first
          descriptions of protocol elements.  Add text explaining why one
          may not have a webkdc-proxy token with other forms of
          authentication.
</dd>
<dt>2.01 (2006-01-23, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Move the document history into an
          appendix.  Document the magic WEBKDC prefix to proxy
          subjects.
</dd>
<dt>2.10 (2006-02-17, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Add a specification for the encoding of
          Kerberos credentials in tokens.  Specify the size of
          timestamps.
</dd>
<dt>2.11 (2008-03-14, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Add error code 18, indicating that the
          WebKDC did not permit the user's principal to authenticate.  Fix
          typo in the webkdcProxyTokenInfoRequest example.  Fix XML
          formatting issues.
</dd>
<dt>2.12 (2009-06-24, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Add requestedTokenType to the XML
          returned in response to &lt;requestToken> so that the WebLogin
          component can make decisions based on whether the WAS requested
          an id token or a proxy token.
</dd>
<dt>2.13 (2010-05-15, rra)</dt>
<dd>
          Replace all mentions of krb5_mk_req with
          KRB_AP_REQ, which is the correct protocol term for the results
          of a krb5_mk_req call.
